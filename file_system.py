#You need to implement the following methods:

#1. ls(path: str) -> List[str]
#If path is a file: return a list containing only the file name.


#If path is a directory: return a list of all files and directories in lexicographic order in that directory.

#2. mkdir(path: str) -> None
#Creates a directory structure along the specified path.

#Any intermediate directories that do not exist should also be created.

#3. addContentToFile(filePath: str, content: str) -> None
#If the file does not exist, it is created with the given content.

#If the file already exists, the new content is appended to the existing content.

#4. readContentFromFile(filePath: str) -> str
#Returns the entire content of the file at the specified path.

fs = FileSystem()

fs.mkdir("/a/b/c")
fs.addContentToFile("/a/b/c/d", "hello")
fs.ls("/")                        # returns ['a']
fs.readContentFromFile("/a/b/c/d")  # returns 'hello'

"""
Explanation:

mkdir("/a/b/c") creates the directory path step by step.

addContentToFile(...) creates file d and stores content "hello".

ls("/") shows ['a'] because a is the only top-level directory.

readContentFromFile(...) returns the content of the file.

"""

"""
 Design Considerations:
Use a Trie-like tree structure where each node represents a file or directory.

Track:

children (dict of subdirectories/files)

is_file (to distinguish files from directories)

content (only for file nodes)
