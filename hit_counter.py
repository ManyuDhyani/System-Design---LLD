# - [362. Design Hit Counter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/)
"""
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (300 seconds).

Implement the following methods:
void hit(int timestamp) Record a hit at the given timestamp (in seconds).

int getHits(int timestamp) Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from the given timestamp.

You may assume timestamp is increasing with each call.


üîç Time/Space:
Time: O(1) for hit(), O(300) for getHits()

Space: O(300)
